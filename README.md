# XASECO
XASECO stands for Xymph's ASECO and is a controller for TrackMania servers. It used to be known as ASECO/RASP for classic TMN until the release of TM Forever. ASECO is an abbreviation of "Automatic SErver COntrol", while RASP is a sizable set of plugins for ASECO that defacto became a standard part of the distribution.  Beyond RASP the system comes with a sizable number of optional plugins, which are typically enabled on most servers as well. The overall goal remains to stick to 'core functionality' as much as possible, rather than include any of the wide variety of 'niche' plugins that exist out there, while still providing a complete and integrated solution for server control.

# THIS PROJECT
The code and also the requirements to run XASECO are outdated. This may cause security risks for the server used. PHP and also MySQL have evolved, also the operating systems are no longer at the level of 2013. The goal is to release versions for PHP7 / PHP8 and MySQL / MariaDB. The name will be kept out of respect to the original authors and because of the Trackmania community.
