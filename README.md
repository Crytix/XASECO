# XASECO
XASECO stands for Xymph's ASECO and is a controller for TrackMania servers. It used to be known as ASECO/RASP for classic TMN until the release of TM Forever. ASECO is an abbreviation of "Automatic SErver COntrol", while RASP is a sizable set of plugins for ASECO that defacto became a standard part of the distribution.  Beyond RASP the system comes with a sizable number of optional plugins, which are typically enabled on most servers as well. The overall goal remains to stick to 'core functionality' as much as possible, rather than include any of the wide variety of 'niche' plugins that exist out there, while still providing a complete and integrated solution for server control.
